My name is Gufeng Yu from Yueyang, Hunan. I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/index.aspx), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Yang Yang](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/PeopleDetail.aspx?id=72). I obtained my Bachelor's degree from School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2023. 

My research interest is **AI for Science**. Specifically, the main research areas are the application of AI in genomics and organic chemistry. Examples include gene regulatory network reconstruction, cancer genomics and chemical reaction prediction.
